# Hello Website (blank)

This is a basic static HTML starter project you can build on however you like. No need to save. While you develop your site, your changes will happen ü™Ñ immediately in the preview window. You can upload assets like images or audio in `assets` to the left. The rest is up to you and your imagination.

## What's in this project?

‚Üê `README.md`: That's this file, where you can tell people what your cool website does and how you built it.

‚Üê `index.html`: This is the main HTML page for your site.

‚Üê `style.css`: CSS files add styling rules to your content.

‚Üê `script.js`: If you're feeling fancy you can add interactivity to your site with JavaScript.
